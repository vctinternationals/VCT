            According to NFPA, non-maintenance of kitchen exhaust systems is the main reason for extreme fire hazards in Restaurants & Canteens. The Kitchen exhaust system accumulates thick layers of oil, grease, etc. which becomes extremely fire hazardous when it reaches the ignition temperature. Proper cleaning and periodic maintenance is the only way to avert these fire accidents. With our state-of-the-art automatic cleaning machines, the oil and grease settlements are completely removed from ducts. Not only that, we also take care of Air Filters, smoke residue, bacterial and fungal infections. Kitchen exhaust ducts are restored to their original finish, helping you save electricity consumption and prevent fire accidents.

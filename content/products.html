                    For safer, healthier buildings, take advantage of innovative cutting edge UVC technology. By
                    continuously cleaning HVAC evaporator coils and drain pans of mold and bacteria, UVC technology
                    helps reduce the largest single reservoir of pathogens at the source. Numerous studies have
                    shown that the heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) system is an amplifier,
                    reservoir and transportation mode for mold and bacteria throughout a building. These biologicals
                    have also been linked to hospital acquired infections as well as Sick Building Syndrome and
                    Allergy and Asthma triggers.

                    These are quartz based UV lamp manufactured from high-quality quartz which permits over 90% of
                    the UV energy generated to be transmitted through the lamp. These UV quartz lamps are used
                    world-wide for water, air & surface disinfection. Quartz UV lamps are therefore preferred for
                    industrial and commercial applications.
